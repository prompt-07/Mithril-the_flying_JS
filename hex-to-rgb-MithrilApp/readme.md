### Based on [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) v2.0.4 hex-to-rgb is a simple yet effective application it not only helps user effectively exchange the color-codes but also gives them a glimpse of it. It draws its inspiration from old school jQuery dom manuplations.

-----

### Basic dom manuplations inside 'wrap'
```javascript

var root = document.getElementById('wrap');

m.mount(root, {
	view: ()=> m(fetchColor, {colorCode: '#4682b4'})
});
